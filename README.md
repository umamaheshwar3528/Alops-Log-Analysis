# Alops-Log-Analysis Project

This project is designed to perform detailed analysis of system log files. It includes scripts to parse log data, identify anomalies, and display detailed log entries using Python and data science libraries such as Pandas and Scikit-Learn.

## Project Structure

- **`simple_log_analysis.py`**: This script parses the log file, checks for error rates within specified intervals, and detects anomalies based on a predefined threshold.
- **`aiops_log_analysis.py`**: This script extends the basic log analysis by applying machine learning models to identify anomalies in the log data.
- **`system_logs.txt`**: The log file containing system logs that are analyzed by the scripts.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.11.0
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn

## Setup Instructions

1. **Environment Setup**:
    - Ensure Python 3.11.0 is installed on your system.
    - Clone this repository or download the scripts and log file into your working directory.
    - Set up a Python virtual environment in your project directory:
      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      ```
    - Activate the virtual environment:
      - Windows:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\Activate
        ```
      - Linux/Mac:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
    - Install all required Python libraries using pip:
      ```bash
      pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
      ```

## Usage

- **Running the Simple Log Analysis**:
    ```bash
    python simple_log_analysis.py
    ```
  This script reads the `system_logs.txt`, parses it to extract log entries, and performs a simple anomaly detection based on error log frequency within a 30-second window.

- **Running the AI-Enhanced Log Analysis**:
    ```bash
    python aiops_log_analysis.py
    ```
  This script uses an Isolation Forest model to detect anomalies in the log data, based on features like log level severity and message length.

## Features

- **Log Parsing**: Extracts timestamp, log level, and message from each log entry.
- **Anomaly Detection**:
  - Simple threshold-based detection for frequent errors.
  - Machine learning-based anomaly detection using log features.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Outputs a detailed DataFrame showing all logs and, separately, the detected anomalies.

## Data Format

The expected format of each log entry in `system_logs.txt` is:
```
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS LEVEL Message
```
Ensure your log entries match this format to be correctly parsed and analyzed by the scripts.
